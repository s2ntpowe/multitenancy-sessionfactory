# multitenancy-sessionfactory
Repurposed this project from Elizabetht and added GenericHibernateDAO and MultiTenancy - Multiple Databases. The reason for adding GenericHibernateDAO is because I am emulating another project that already using GenericHibernateDAO with SessionFactory. However, that project needs Multi-tenants and I wanted to get it working with a smaller project before tackling it on a much larger scale.
